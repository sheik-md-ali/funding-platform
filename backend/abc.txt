## **💡 Student Wallet & Scholarship System (Final Refined Model)**  

### **1️⃣ Direct Microdonations (PhonePe UPI QR Code)**
✅ **How It Works:**  
- A **verified student** generates a **QR code & UPI ID** using **PhonePe Business API**.  
- They share it on **social media** or **display it on your platform**.  
- **Donors send money directly** to the student’s bank account via UPI.  

✅ **How the Platform Tracks Donations:**  
- PhonePe **webhooks** log every donation and update the **“Funds Raised” tracker** on the student’s profile.  
- The platform does **not control spending**, but **ensures transparency** by tracking total donations received.  

🚀 **Goal:**  
- **Fast & direct donations** with **zero platform fees** (except standard UPI charges).  
- **Donor trust** because they know the student gets the money directly.  
- **Platform ensures tracking but doesn’t interfere with spending.**

### **2️⃣ Scholarship Donations (Controlled Fund Distribution)**  

#### **2A – Donor/Company Chooses a Specific Student**  
✅ **How It Works:**  
1️⃣ **Donor browses verified students** on the platform.  
2️⃣ They **select a student** they wish to support.  
3️⃣ **Donor funds the student’s scholarship** → Money goes to the **Platform’s RazorpayX Merchant Account**.  
4️⃣ The student **requests a withdrawal for education expenses**.  
5️⃣ **Admin approves the request**, ensuring funds are used only for tuition, books, or hostel fees.  
6️⃣ **RazorpayX transfers money directly** to the respective institution (college, bookstore, hostel, etc.).  

🚀 **Goal:**  
- **Donors get transparency** by selecting the student they want to help.  
- **Students get controlled funds**, ensuring money is used for education.  
- **No direct access to cash**, avoiding misuse.

#### **2B – Donor Gives to the Platform (Platform Chooses the Student)**  
✅ **How It Works:**  
1️⃣ **Donor/Company donates a large amount** to the platform’s **RazorpayX Merchant Account**.  
2️⃣ **Platform selects eligible students** based on academic performance, need, and verification.  
3️⃣ Students **apply for the scholarship**, and **admin approves based on criteria**.  
4️⃣ **Approved students request funds** for tuition, books, or hostel fees.  
5️⃣ **Platform directly pays the institution** (via RazorpayX Payouts).  

🚀 **Goal:**  
- Allows **large-scale donors** to support students without selecting individuals.  
- **Platform ensures fair distribution** of funds based on need and eligibility.  
- Ensures **100% funds go to education** without misuse.
